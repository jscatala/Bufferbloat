\item To select or develop appropriate test to be able to prove the existence of \textit{Bufferbloat}
\item To test and differentiate the possible cause of the excesive latency and throughput in a TCP/IP LAN and proof how much is generated by the \textit{Bufferbloat} or by a miss-configuration. 
\item To propose a possible configuration of the TCP parameters in a Linux based machine or an algorithm that can help to minimize the phenomenon.
