The objective of this thesis work consists of checking the effects of the existence of the \textit{BufferBloat} phenomenon, test the impact that it has in diffetent networks like residential networks, school network or/and department network and to analyze possible solutions. To accomplish this, it's first required to address the following general objectives:
\begin{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item To explain the \textit{BufferBloat} phenomenon, and explain the impact that it could have over the lantecy and throughtput in Internet.  
\item To detect the presence by a empirical mesure of the latency and throughput in a TCP/IP based LAN. 
\item To propose possible solutions in the implementation of a network where the existence of excessively large and frequently full buffers are detected, by mesuring and modeling the effects.
\end{itemize}
\end{center}
