It presents the basis of how this phenomenon is gestated, specially how it relates with the ways that buffers are deplayed and used. It also presents how the performance of a network is affected by the effect of the buffer configuration and the fundamentals of TCP behavior with active queue management. At the end, it exposes the effects of bufferbloat on daily basis and some ways to mitigate the problem.
