It is well know that residential networks are often the bottleneck in the last
mile access to the Internet Infrastructure. This could be because the ISP's of
both of the most popular ways to access (DSL and cable networks) to internet
today, use traffic shaping methods and ,as seen in previous sections, deploy
massive queues that can delay packets for several hundred milliseconds.\\

Both shares the asymmetric bandwidths; they downstream bandwidth is higher than
their upstream bandwidth, but in cable networks a single coaxial cable shares
multiple customers, they can concatenate multiple upstream packets into a single
transmission, which result in short bursts at high data rates, so the latency
can heavily fluctuate. This concatenation can produce a jitter time, that under
high network load can be higher than end-to-end jitter over the entire path
under normal load, which can be produce a miss interpretation for some protocols
of incipient congestion and cause to enter into congestion control avoidance too
early.\\

In the other hand, in DSL networks, the maximum data transmission
rate falls with increasing distance from the head, thus in order to boost the
transmission rate, DSL relies on advanced signal processing and error correction
algorithms which can lead to high packet propagation delays .\\
