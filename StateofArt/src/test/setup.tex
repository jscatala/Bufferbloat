The tests will be run under a pseudo controlled enviroment, using one physical 
machine and a second virtual machine hosted in first machine. These machines 
runs under regular OS without any modification beside the ones that OS provides.
Also, for some tests two other devices will be added, one acting as a Iperf 
Server and a regular Android Tablet will be used to put some extra load into the
network.\\

This tests will be carried out in a real-world scenario, where no packet 
priorization by the server will be present, and the routes 


\subsubsection{Hardware Characterization}

\begin{description}

\item [Physical Machine] \hfill \\
The physical machine runs as host OS, Windows 7 SP1, that works with a Intel(R)
Core(TM) i7-2670QM CPU \@ 2.20GHz with 8Gb of avaible RAM. This machill will 
always be connected through its wireless adapter, a \textit{Broadcom Corp. 
BCM4313 802.11b/g/n Wireless LAN Controller (rev 01)}. The Ethernet controller 
is a \textit{Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8111/8168 PCI Express Gigabit 
Ethernet controller (rev 06)}, adapter will be bridged to the virtual 
machine in some tests.\\

\item[Virtual Machine] \hfill \\
The virtual machine is hosted using VMWare Player 6.0.1, with 4 processors 
assigned for use plus 4Gb of RAM, and with the Ethernet adapter connected only
for certain tests. The OS selected is a Debian based OS called Kali Linux, and
using the kernel release identified as Debian 3.12.6-2kalii1.\\

The wireless adapter is a AIR-802 USB adapter with Zydas chipset and a TP-link 
8dbi antenna. This adapter is directly connected to the virtual machine and 
hooked to the physical machine without the adapter, this way any extra signal 
loss is avoided. \\

\item[Iperf Server] \hfill \\
This machine will be used as a server for the iperf test. This is a vps hosted 
by Digital Ocean \footnote{\url{https://digitalocean.com}} with 512MB Ram, and 
20GB SSD Disk, and located in New York data center. This machine runs Ubuntu 
12.04.3 x64 under KVM software using as a processor a Intel Hex-Core 3 GHz.
