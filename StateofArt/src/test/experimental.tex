The goal of the experiments outlined in this section is to examine different 
residential and public networks looking for checking the existence of the 
phenomenon under a uncontrolled scenario. This will be done by running a set of 
tests with different tools first to define the characterize and then measure the 
behaviour of the networks with and without any load. More specifically, latency 
under load is tested and analyzed to identify if the latency that occurs is due 
to an excess of buffers or due to some other problem.\\

This section aims to explain the setup that will be used to perform the tests,
the different tools used in each of these tests and what is to be achieved and 
expected from each one of these tests.\\
