buffers

Unmaneged buffers are more critical today since buffers size are larger, delay sensitive applications are more prevalent, and large (streaming) downloads common

Packet networks require buffers to absorb short-term arrival rate fluctuations. Although essential to the operation of packet networks, buffers tend to fill up and remain full at congested links, contributing to excessive traffic delay and losing the ability to perfom their intended function of absorbing bursts.

Correct buffer sizing is not an easy problem. Undersizing - making buffers smaller than the traditional BDP- is fraught with problems. Today's links vary in bandwidth, and individual connections vary in rtt. This makes it impossible to properly pick a static size for most edge links. A simple, robust algorith that can manage buffer delay regardless of buffer size and link bandwidth without a negative impact on utilization can make oversized buffers irrelevant.

Queue occurs in buffers as a result of short-term missmatches in traffic arrivals and departure rates that arise from upstream resource contention, transport conversation stratup transients, and/or changes in the number of conversations sharing a link.
