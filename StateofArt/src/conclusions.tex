timeout debido al largo tiempo en que los paquetes pasan en los buffers.

For example, when you click on a link, multiple messages pass between your system and the web server and, until enough messages have been exchanged, the page will not begin to appear. Thus you generally want low latency, as this makes your web surfing feel faster and enables better performance in online games and VoIP (Internet Telephony) technology.

Latency can be affected by many things. If the remote server is far away, latency is higher. If there is significant other activity on the network, you may also experience higher latency. Some access technologies such as satellite communication also add very high latency.

Also from \cite{main:ref:1} and \cite{Vu-Brugier}, we can see that the rule-of-thumb doesn't longer apply to backbone routers, and a better estimator of the size of a buffer with n flows would be no more than $B = (\overline{RTT}xC)/\sqrt{n}$. With the assumption that short-flows plays a very small effect, and that the buffer size is dictated by the number of long flows, this factor will be proof that routers are much longer than they need to be, possible by two order of magnitude.
