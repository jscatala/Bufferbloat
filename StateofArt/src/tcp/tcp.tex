The Transport Control Protocol or TCP is the main transport protocol of 
Internet, providing reliable host to host communication over unreliable
transport media\cite{rfc793}. The advantages of its design,
flexibility and robustness provides reliable, ordered delivery of a stream of
bytes from a program on one computer to another program on another computer,
but for that, one of the costs is the need of careful design so it provides a good
service under heavy loads. Many modifications have been done since it was
originally defined in 1981.

The root idea of any algorithm related to transport connections must be based
on the ``\textit{packet conservation principle}''. This principle claims:

\begin{defn}
A new packet isn't put into the network until an old packet leaves.
\end{defn}
