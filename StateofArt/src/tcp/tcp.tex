The Transport Control Protocol or TCP is main transport protocol of the
internet, providing reliable host to host communication over unreliable
transport media\cite{RFC793}. The advantages of its connectionless design,
flexibility and robustness provides reliable, ordered delivery of a stream of
bytes from a program on one computer to another program on another computer,
but for that, the cost are: the needed of careful design so it provides a good
service under heavy loads. Many modifications has been done since it was
originally defined in 1981.

The root idea of any algorithm related to transport connections must be based
into the ``\textit{packet conservation principle}". This principle claims:

\begin{defn}
A new packet isn't put into the network until an old packet leaves.
\end{defn}
